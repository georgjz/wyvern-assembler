# Wyvern Assembler

This repository is WIP. The goal is to write an assembler for targeting machines that run on the [6502][1], [Z80][2], and [68k][3] processor families.

The motivation and development diary are documented on [my blog](https://georgjz.github.io/wyvern-01/).

If you wish to learn more about Wyvern's architecture, check the `doc` directory. I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to document my progress there. You can read those files with a normal text editor as well.
